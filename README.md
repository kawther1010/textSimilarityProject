# Text Similarity Project

## Overview

This project explores text similarity using various techniques such as Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, TF-IDF Cosine Similarity, and TF-IDF Euclidean Distance.

## Techniques Used

### Cosine Similarity

Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two documents are, based on the cosine of the angle between their vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar).

### Euclidean Distance

Euclidean Distance is a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a space. In the context of text similarity, it quantifies the dissimilarity between TF-IDF vectors.

### TF-IDF Cosine Similarity

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. TF-IDF Cosine Similarity uses these vectors to measure the similarity between two texts, with values ranging from -1 to 1.

### TF-IDF Euclidean Distance

TF-IDF Euclidean Distance measures the dissimilarity between TF-IDF vectors of two texts using the Euclidean Distance metric. It provides a numeric value representing how different the texts are based on the importance of terms.

## Getting Started
